Group By 
 - can group on a column/s
 - can group only on a column/s that are in the select list
 - will have to group  on all columns that are in the select list
 - cannot group on an alias column
 - can have aggregates
 - excluding aggregates, all columns in the select list will have to be a part of group by 

select col1, col4, avg(col5)
from table
where condition
group by col1,col4
having avg(col5)>/</=/<=/>=/!= (value)
order by

-Where places restriction on the number of rows to be displayed
-having, places restriction on the number groups to be displayed
-having works after the group is formed, where as where works before the group is formed.


Joins: 

Subquery : Query within another query
           Enclosed in parenthesis
           Are placed to the right side of the comparison condition/operator
           Use single-row operators with single row subqueries and multirow operator with multi row subqueries

2 types of subqueries:
 1. Single row : query that returns a single row
     - can be used with single row operator(<,>,=,<=,>=,!=,<>)
 2. Multiple row : query that returns multiple rows
     - can be used with multi row operator(in, any, all)

Indexes : Speeds up the search/access of any data in a table 
          - Enforces uniqueness of rows

On indexing a column, the system creates a seperate index table

Types : 2 types
1. Clustered Index
 - are applied automatically on the Primary key
 - only one clustered index/table is allowed
2.  Non Clusterd Index (can create on many columns)
    Unique nonclustered - that creates uniquness, no duplicates
   


Programming with SQL is called as T-Sql(Transact Sql)
