Exception Handling :
Error Number : This is a unique identifier given for each and every error that occurs in SQL server. 
-This value will be below 50,000 for predefined errors and must be above 50000 for user defined errors

Error Message : It is a brief information describing the error occured, which should be maximum 2047 characters

Severity Level : This tells about the importance of the error which ranges between 0 and 24
  0-9 : are not severe, and considered to be as info. or status
  11-16 : Indicates errors created by the user
  17-19 : Indicates software errors, that cannot be corrected by the user. It must be reported to the admin
  20-24 : Fatal errors, which can damage the system or the database. 

State: It is arbitrary value that ranges between 0-127. 

raise syntax : raiserror(errorid/msg,severity,state)

throw syntax : throw (errorno/id,errormsg,state)

to add user defined error messages. You have to add it to the sys.messages table

select * from sys.messages

	exec sp_addmessage 60000,13,'It is an Errormessage'
	
Procedures : can have input/output and return parameters(return parameter is optional and is always an integer)
-we can have all sql statements inside the procedure
-we can have transactions
-we can have error handlers
-we can call other procedures and or functions

Functions: have to return one scalar data.
- Can have only input parameters
- can use only select statements
- cannot be used to perform transactions/error handling
- can be called using select where clauses only
- we can call only other functions from within a function

create function <function name> (parameter list)
returns <scalar datatype>
as
begin
--statements
<return> --(actual returning of the value that should match the returns datatype)
end

Transactions : Are a way to ensure that a unit of work is either completely done or completely undone.
-A unit of work means some sql statements that are likely to change the database/table contents
-Rollback command is given to undo the changes made
-Commit commnad is given to make the changes permanent
Save transaction: is a logical marker that marks some statement which can be committed later

Properties of Transaction : ACID
A : Atomicity
C : Consistency
I : Isolation   - locks applied(row level, page level, table level)
D : Durability

set implicit_transaction off/on

Triggers: Are also reusable piece of sql statements that get fired automatically, whenever there is any dml/ddl operations taking place on a table/database
-They are means of enforcing business rules which cannot be done using constraints
-Triggers are of types:
 1. After Trigger - fires after the dml/ddl operations are completed
 2. Before Trigger - fires before the actual dml/ddl operations
 3. Instead of Trigger - fires the trigger and not the dml/ddl operations

Triggers can be written either on insert or update or delete (or for all three actions/events) on a particular relation/table
V.Imp: Triggers create 2 magic tables automatically, which can be accessed within the body of the trigger
-They are known as Inserted and Deleted

create trigger <trigger name> on <table name> for <insert/update/delete>
as  
begin
--sql statements
end

-Differences between Delete and Truncate

both delete all the rows of the table
both retains the object(structure of the table)

-truncate is a DDL while delete is a DML
-truncate cannot be given with where clause, while delete can be given
-cannot rollback after giving truncate command
-we can rollback after delete command
-truncate is faster than delete
