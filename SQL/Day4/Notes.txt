string functions: 
Data Types : 
Stored Procedures: a set of sql statements/instructions of execution that is written once and stored as an object inside the database.
-It can be called many time(resuability)
-it improves performance of the query

Every time a query is executed, the database engine creates a query plan of execution and then executes as per the plan - might consume more time

-with stored procedures, the query plan is created only once and stored along with the object

create procedure <procedurename>
as
begin
sql statements
end

to execute the stored procedure
execute <procedurename>
exec <procedurename>

1. All procedures returns an integer datatype
2. Procedures may take parameters, and give output/s also
3. Parameters can either be input or output or input/output

note: incase we need any return values from the procedure, we can make use of the return parameter - provided the return values is integer. No other datatype is supported as a return value
