Dr. EF Codd - 12 Golden Rules

Dr.Chen

table 1 - has 6 columns
create table table1(
col1 datatype size,
col2 datatype size not null,
col3
col4
col5
col6 datatype size)

Insert into table1(col1,col3,col4,col5)
values(1,2,3,4),(    ),(    )

RelationalAlgebra :
1  Restriction - restricts number of rows that are displayed
2. Projection - projects only the cloumns required
3. Join/Intersection - links one or more table and gets the data
4. Union
5. Difference
6. Divide

select - DQL
Operators that are supported in select command
1. Arithmetic (+,-,*,/)
2. Relational (<,>,<=,>=,!=,<>,=)
3. Logical (not, and, or)
4. Functions
  count(*) will include all rows with duplication,null etc
  distinct() excludes duplication

* - all columns - selection
column list - projection
where - restriction




sorting the output based on column/s
 - order by multiple columns
 - order by on a column either ascending or descending
 - order by on an alias name of a column
 - order by on a column that is not in the select statement
