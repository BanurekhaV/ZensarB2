ASP.Net MVC : Is a popular framework for developing web applications
-It is based on Model View Controller Architecture
-It is a successor to asp.net web forms


It is light weight, fast, secure
Designs and codes are neatly separated
It uses pure HTML control or HTML Helper class(No server control/asp control)
It uses controller based URL
Implements no view state
It uses Razor Syntax for customization
It uses Layout in place of Master Pages for consistent look and feel
It is an Open Source 

We can see clear seperation of concerns as MVC - an design pattern

Model : It is responsible for keeping the data (operational logic like connecting, retrieving information from the Datasource(database,class objects,xml,entities)

View: It is responsible for serving web pages/User Interface(UI) to the client. It Can be a combination of both the program code and html code. The extension of view files are .cshtml. They have the same name as that of the controllers action method

Controller : All Business Logics are managed here.
-They have action methods
-By default there is one action method called as Index()
-All action methods are derivation of a base class called as ActionResult
  - the various types of action methods are :
      1. ViewResult
      2. Empty Result 
      3. Content Result
      4. JSON result
      5. File Result
      6. Partial View
      7. RedirectResult

Controllers methods can either be action methods or non-action methods.
Action Methods : are those methods that can be routed
Non-Action Methods : cannot be routed


Exercise : create a model called Product with {product id, productname, productprice}

Data transfer from controller to View:
 ViewData, ViewBag, TempData

Data transfer from view to controller:
  Model Object, Parameters(the name should match the property of the model),FormCollection, Request Object)
