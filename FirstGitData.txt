This is a sample file to understand git transactions. Steps for git operations

1. Either signin or signup to github.
2. create a new repository (public) in github
3. After creating a new repo, copy the URL address

1. Create a directory/folder in your working drive 
2. move to that newly created director (cd <name of the directory>)
3. git init and press enter
4. You can create a simple file (a text file and type some data and save it)
5. git add. (to add the newly created file to a stage area)
6. git commit -m"<some meaningful name>"

7. In order to sync the Local repo with remote repo, type the command
 git remote add <somename>(orign) and then paste the url address
8. to check the sync, type git remote -v
9. Then push the added contents to remote by typing
git push origin master

10. Then observe that the file is available in the remote repo

11. If we want to get the latest files from the remote repo to our local repo then type
git pull origin master
