Web Services:

Web service is a software module that is intended to carry out specific ste of functions. 
-Is a standardised method for propogating messages between client and server applications.
-Is a set of open protocols and standards for data exchange
-Web services can be used by software programs written in a variety of langs. and running on varitey of platforms to exchange data over the net.

Functions of Web Services :

-Access via internet or intranet networks
-XML messaging is standard
-Platform, Lang independent
-easily locatable 

Components of Web Service:
1. SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol (built on xml to echange soap messages)
2. UDDI - (Universal Description,Discovery and Integration)- Is a standard for specifying, publishing and discovering a service providers online services. It serves as a database of WSDL files(Web services description Lang.)
The UDDI registry holds the required information for the online services, just ike a telephone directory with name, address, phone nos.
3. WSDL - (Web services description Lang.)It is an xml based file that explains what the web service does to the client application,location of the webservice and how to use it thru WSDL documents



The various techniques to request and consume services/data from server:
1. RPC - Remote Procedure Calls
2. Remoting
3. Web Services
4. WCF - Windows Communication Framework
5. Restful APi's

Steps to create a webservice application:

- launch an empty asp.net(framework) project
- add a new item (webservices.asmx) and name it as MyWebService1
- you should notice the various decorators created for the above webservices
- also observe your webservice is inherited from Web.Webservice

- write various functions that you need it to be exposed by using [WebMethod] attribute
- write the definitions for the functions 
- build it
- right click on the asmx, webservice that you created and run it with a browser.
- you will observe the list of operations (methods)exposed by the service, also the WSDL(webservice description Lang)  file with xml tags and soap request and response objects.
- you can actually check the functionality from the browser itself
- if everything is working fine, create a client app to consume the webservices

- add a new project or create a fresh application. Empty project
- add  reference (service reference of the web service - URL) in the window displayed and press Go or discover.
  You should see a list of service methods in the dialog box.
- then give a proxy name in the text box below the dialogbox. click OK
- Observe under connected service, you will see the proxy object (this object helps in invoking webservice functions)


- create the required web forms to access the various functions of the webservice.

Ensure server services are running.

Invoke the client application and use the functionalities.
