Software Development Life Cycle: SDLC

1. Waterfall Model 
2. Protype Mode
3. V shaped
4. Spiral Model

Testing : is a process of validating and verifying a software program/application/product

TDD : Test Driven Development

  -NUnit Testing - open source unit testing framework for dotnet applications
  -MSTests - from Microsoft -Inbuilt in VS

Unit : refers to a smallest piece of code(I-P-O)

Testing Methodology : works on a concept of 3A's
  1. Arrange
  2. Act
  3. Assert


1. Create a class library application. Call it as MainProject. 
2. Change the class name from class1 to Accounts
3. Write all the methods required as per the demo
4. Build it. It will create a .dll namespace

1. Now create another class library project (within the same solution or different VS application)
2. give the name of the project as Testing_MainProject
3. Go to tools and select nuget packaage -> manage nuget for solutions
4. in Browse type nunit.
5. Add NUnit Adapter and NUnit to the Testing_MainProject by clicking install
6. Then change the class name from class1 to TestAcooun
7. Then add the test methods as per the demo
8. Go to the Test menu option and select testExplorer (this will open the window for testing)
9. Run the test methods and see the output. 

10. You can change or write new methods to test

MS Test
Attributes
[TestClass] - to declare a class as test class
[TestMethod] - to mark a method as test 
[TestInitialize] - executed before every test method
[TestCleanup] - executed after every test method
[ClassInitialize] - is executed once before all the testmethods (you need to make the class initialize method public static void and should pass a testcontext parameter
[ClassCleanup] - is executed after all the test methods(i.e once). 
[AssemblyInitialize] - is executed once before the class object is initialized (you need to make the assembly initialize method public static void and should pass a testcontext parameter
[AssemblyCleanup] - is executed after all the test methods and class cleanup (once)
