We have two projects CustomerOrderService project which is a class library and CustomerOrderService.Tests project which is a NUnit test project.

First create two classes Customer and Order and one enum CustomerType in CustomerOrderService project as below


public enum CustomerType
    {
        Basic,
        Premium,
        SpecialCustomer
    }
}
 

    public class Customer
    {
        public int CustomerId { get; set; }
        public string CustomerName { get; set; }
        public CustomerType CustomerType { get; set; }
    }

 

    public class Order
    {
        public int OrderId { get; set; }
        public int ProductId { get; set; }
        public int ProductQuantity { get; set; }
        public decimal Amount { get; set; }
    }


public class CustomerOrderService
    {
        public void ApplyDiscount(Customer customer, Order order)
        {
            if (customer.CustomerType == CustomerType.Premium)
            {
                order.Amount = order.Amount - ((order.Amount * 10) / 100);
            }
            else if(customer.CustomerType == CustomerType.SpecialCustomer)
            {
                order.Amount = order.Amount - ((order.Amount * 20) / 100);
            }
        }
    }

In the above method, we are giving 10% discount to Premium customers and 20% discount to Special Customers. We are not giving any discount to Basic customers.

Now add the CustomerOrderService.Tests project to test the above class and functions (include the above project reference and install NUnit and NUnitAdapter

Write test cases that find out if discount percentages are as expected by creating all relevant data (AAA) etc.
