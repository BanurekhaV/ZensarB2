Thread t1= new Thread(Method1); //internally it invokes a delegate called as threadstart
t1.start();

//the above can also be done thru a threadstart object itself

            // Thread t1 = new Thread(obj);
            // t1.Start();

//The above can aslo be done as follows:

1. Thread t1=new thread(new ThreadStart(DisplayNumbers));
2. Thread t1= new Thread(delegate(){DisplayNumbers();}); // Anonymous
3. Thread t1= new Thread(()=>{DisplayNumbers();}); //lambda expression
4. Thread t1= new Thread(()=>DisplayNumbers());     ""
