•	Write your own new application Exception class. 
•	This new Exception will be thrown in case of withdrawal of money from the account where customer doesn’t have sufficient balance.


Case Study Plan:
--------------

- Create Student class (id, name, dateofbirth)
  - Cover constructors, getters and setters

- Create class Info
  - Write a method called as:
	public void display(Student student) {
		//Code here to display the details of given student
	}

- Create App class with main method. Then

  - Write a method called as scenario1 to:
	- Create few objects of Student class
	- Call the display method of Info class

  - Write a method called as scenario2 to:
	- Create array of Student class and store few objects in it
	- Demonstrate how to iterate over the array and call the display method for each student

  - Write a method called as scenario3 to:
	- Take Student data as input from the user, store it in Student object
	- Repeat the above process using loops
	- Use Arrays to store the Student objects as covered in scenario2
	- Finally iterate over the array to display all the collected data

- Now  create Course class  (id, name, duration, fees)
  - Modify Info class by adding one more method:
	public void display(Course course) {
		//Code here to display the details of given course
	}
  
 
- Organize the code using in namespaces
