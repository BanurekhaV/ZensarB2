To Link the Local Repository to the Global/Remote/ Repository

we have to sync both the repositories by giving the git command as
 localrepo: git remote add <alias name> <url>
                           training-assignment
                            origin

to test the above links of 2 repositories type

git remote -v and check

training-assignment   https://github.com/Kranthissk07/training-assignment.git (fetch)
training-assignment   https://github.com/Kranthissk07/training-assignment.git (push)

git push <alias name> master - (branch)

Arrays : are reference type variables since the array variable wil always store the address of the starting location i.e. index 0
int[]arr={1,2,3,45};  or
int[] arr;
arr= new int[5]; arr[0]=3;arr[1]=5; ....

int[,] twodimarray= new int[3,7]
                           [row][col]
twodimarray[0][0]=10
twodimarray[0][1]=12

twodimarray[1][0]=15

Jagged Array : int [][]

for, while, dowhile, foreach

Methods and Parameters :
Parameters or Arguments are variables/objects that are passed to a function as input
return value : is the data/value that is given back by the function

 1. call by value - a copy of the data is sent to the called function 
 2. call by ref - the location of the data is sent to the called function
 3. out parameters - 
        All functions may or may not return any value. But if a function is returning a value, then it can be only one value. If we need multiple values from a function,we use out parameters
 4. params :
