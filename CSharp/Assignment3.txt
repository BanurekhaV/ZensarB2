1. Create a class called student which has data members like rollno, name, class, semester, branch, int [] marks=new int marks [5](marks of 5 subjects)
. Hint:(you can initialize the marks array with marks )

-Write a method called displayResult, which should calculate the average marks as below :(Hint : use loops to access the marks)
	-If marks of any one subject is less than 35 print result as failed
	-If marks of all subject is >35 but average is < 50 then also print result as failed
	-If avg > 50 then print result as passed.
-Pass the details of student like rollno, name, class, semester, branch through constructor
-Write a displayData method to display all values.


2. Write a c# program that creates a class called car with 
    int carno, string carname, string cartype (xuv,suv etc..), double cost

 - create properties for all the above fields. 
 - initialize all fields through a parameterized constructor
 - make the cost property readonly
 - write a method to display the values before and after changes 


3. Write a C# program that calculates multiple interest amounts for a given loan amount 
 Accept loanamount from the user and pass it to a loanCalculator(double loanamt) function, that sends all the interest amounts to the caller

 Test data:
Loanamount= 200000

Expected Output:

5% interest= 10000/-
7% interest = 14000/-
10% interest=20000/-
