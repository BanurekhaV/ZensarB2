Datatypes 

1. Value Types : byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean(user defined value types -struct,enum)
2. Reference Types : (predefined reference type -string,object) class,interface,delegate,event

object is the base class for all the classes.

strings are immutable - 
stringBuilder - are mutable strings

All reference types will have nullreference until a valid reference is given

C# supports :

arithmetic operators - +,-,/,*,%
relational operators - >,<,>=,<=,!=,<>,=
logical operators - not, and, or

if((age<=20) && (marks>80)) //both conditions to be true

if((age<=20) || (marks>80)) //any one condition to be true

if(!age<=20) // age should not be <=20

totalmarks+= Marks; totalmarks-=Marks;
totalmarks = totalmarks+Marks;

-- Switch


grade {A+,A,B+,B,C,D,E}

if(grade=="A+"){ cw("Outstanding")}
else if(grade=='A'){ cw("excellent")}

switch(grade)
{
case A+:
case A :
case B+ :
}

debug mode:


1.Write a program in C# to accept the name of the user and greet the user as:
	“Hi! username 
	Welcome to the world of C#”


2.Accept a number from the user and display whether the given number is an odd number or even number.


3. Create a program, which accepts 3 numbers as input from the user and prints the largest and smallest of 3 numbers.


Jump statements :

break : come out of the loop/function/switch case
continue
goto
return
throw

Iteration: Repeation

Loop till some condition is true  value is true

Loop for some number of times  10 , 5 

Loop till the user wishes  Y/N

while, do while, for, foreach

All loops will have 3 statements ( initialization - one tie in the beginning
, condition - evaluated to true or false, if true execute the bosy of the loop, 
if false exit the loop, iterator - change the initial value)

Unary operator - one operand (i++ = i=i+1)1+1=2   ++i

Binary Operator - two operands (a+b)

Ternary Operator - (age<=20?"outstanding":"invalid")

implicit type conversion - is done by the compiler
explicit type conversion - is done by the programmer
