Shallow Copy            vs              				 Deep copy
-stores the reference of the objects of the original memory    	     stores the copies of the objects value

-Reflects changes made either to the new or the old object            Does not reflect changes made by any one of the objects

- faster							      comparatively slower

Garbage Collections:
 This occurs on the basis of the below conditions:
   - System has low physical memory
   - if the memory allotted to various objects in the heap exceeds a preset threshold, then garbage collection occurs
   - if GC.Collect method is called

Phases in GC
  1. Marking Phase : All Live objects reside here
  2. Relocating Phase : All Non active objects
  3. Compacting Phase: All Dead Objects are removes here

Generation 0: All short lived objects (temporary)
Newly allocated Objects
 Generation 1 - Buffered Objects
-> Generation 2  - Long-lived objects

Time Complexity - time taken to execute 

Space Complexity - memory used for execution

Persistance : saving data permanently
Files : 
Serialization - A process of converting objects into  byte streams, to save it for future use.
Deserialization - The reverse of the above process.
  Binary Serialization
  XML Serialization < >
  Soap Serialization
  Json Serialization { }

Threads : Thread is a light weight process
Life Cycle of  a thread : start->ready->(wait/suspend/sleep)->natural death/killed
