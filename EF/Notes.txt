Entity Framework : Is an ORM based open source technique which helps in working with the underlying database without having to know much details about working with database

3 approaches to work with the databses using EF
1. Database first approach (existing database)
2. Code First approach (no database, create thru code)
3. Model First approach ( no databse, no code to create database)

1. DBFirst approach
 - launch visual studio 2019
 - create a console application
 - install Entity Framework from nuget package manager







3. Model first:




ADO(Sql) => Sql server
 1. runtime syntax checking
 2. no type safety
 3. no intellisense support
 4. debugging sql is not possible
 5. code is a combination of sql and oo


Linq to SQL
 1. compile time syntax checking
 2. type safe
 3. intellisense support
 4. debugging possible
 5. pure oo code

Tables -> classes
Columns -> Properties
Rows/records -> Instances
StoredProcedure  -> methods/functions
